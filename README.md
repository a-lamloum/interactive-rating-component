## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

change group of elements display using el.style.display ... 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```js
btn.onclick = () => {
  element.style.display = "none";
  element2.style.display = "Whatever-you-want"
}
```

### Continued development

I realy wanted to add transition animation but I will figure how to do this 😎
